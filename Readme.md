## Description

Fashion MNIST is a database of clothing and accessory images, containing 10 different categories. The goal of this project is to build various models to classify these images and explore different techniques to improve efficiency.

## Data Loading and Preparation

Libraries used:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- itertools

Data preparation:

To improve the performance of the models, the pixels of the images are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255.

## Models and Techniques

The following models are included in this project:

1. Basic Sequential Neural Network (before data normalization)
2. Basic Sequential Neural Network (after data normalization)
3. Basic Sequential Neural Network (learning rate optimization)
